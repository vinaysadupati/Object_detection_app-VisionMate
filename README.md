VisionMate:
Real-Time Object Detection Android App for the Visually Impaired

Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an Android application that assists visually impaired individuals by providing real-time object detection and warnings. Using EfficientDet model, the application detects objects through a live camera feed and announces their presence, enhancing user awareness and safety. The project focuses on making object detection more accessible and practical through various features and optimizations.

Key Features:
Real-Time Object Detection: The application leverages TensorFlow Lite's EfficientDet model to detect objects in real-time from a live camera feed.
Audio Feedback: Detected objects are announced via audio to inform the user about their presence.
Object Motion Detection: The app identifies if objects are approaching the user, adding an extra layer of safety.
Distance and Angle Calculations: Determines the distance and angle of detected objects relative to the user for better spatial awareness.
Smart Detection Announcements: Limits redundant announcements to avoid overwhelming the user with repeated notifications.
This project is part of an effort to create innovative solutions that empower and assist visually impaired individuals by integrating modern deep learning and mobile technologies.
